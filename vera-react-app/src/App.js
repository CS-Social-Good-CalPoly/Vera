A 2018 study by found that 36% of college students are experiencing hunger and lack stable housing. Add in the fact that tuition rates are going up while financial aid is going down, and itâ€™s obvious that most college students and their families are feeling a very tight financial squeeze. But there is help out there. Students struggling to avoid hunger can find several resources to put food on the table while still completing their education."
